# Welcome
Welcome to wFramework, a new thinking framework for the FiveM ecosystem. You might be wondering what the point behind yet another framework is, and why you should use it? Hopefully I'll get to most of that on this page.

## Introduction
I'm going to start off by introducing myself, so that you have some background on me and hopefully why I think I'm capable of creating a framework that's worth your time.

Hi, most people refer to me as Walter. I've done development in many different capacities for quite some time now. For me programming has always been that one thing that I wanted to do when I grew up, my dad is a programmer and I suspect that's what got me started. I've worked in a lot of different fields, but mainly web and game development. Game development and everything to do with creating awesome experiences for people has always been my passion, and it's what got me into FiveM in the first place.

I have both some experience in popular game engines such as Unreal and Unity, and then I have most of my experience in gaming space from scripting for games such as Garry's Mod, DayZ, Minecraft and FiveM.

## Philosophy
When I first joined the FiveM space, I as many of you probably do right now, wanted to open up my own server with some friends. For my very first project I forked the ESX framework and got to work, I quickly ran into a lot of core design flaws and security issues. Upon looking more at generally available resources, I realized that a lot of them was made with a very flawed concept in regards to security. I want to say that I'm aware that there's more options now, and that things have massively improved since then, but we're not quite there with public open source resources yet.

Now I'm not going to hide my goals here, I as most of you have bills to pay. I'm not making this framework with the intention of cashing in, there will for the time being not be any ways do donate should you want to either. In the future I will however probably sell some resources for the framework. I will do my best to make sure that there's always **good** and **open source** options available for every integral part of your server though. There will be a recognized resources section of this wiki, that contains resources for wFramework that I can personally vouch for (paid and free). The developers of these will have to prove their worth, so that we can make sure these scripts uphold the values of wFramework.

## Why wFramework?
In it's current state I won't recommend the framework if you're looking for another ready-to-ship server package. It's super bare bones, and the reason it's on here right now, is to allow others to follow progress and contribute.

## Bridges from other frameworks
I get wanting your favorite resources to work with wFramework, so you can get the best of every world. This however does kind of defeat the purpose of what I'm trying to do here. I want to set a good example for new developers, and provide everyone with a base that's secure and future proof.

*If* we get to a point further down where people won't try the framework cause of missing scripts, I will consider making a bridge. Something to keep in mind is that scripts that access the database directly will not be supported, since we're not going to be using any of the same layouts as other frameworks for our database.

If you're a developer and want to make a bridge, please do reach out on the Discord and I'll provide you with aid in any way I can.
