You want to have less NUI callbacks for cleaner code, great. The problem happens when you let the NUI process tell you what event to call without limits. You need to be aware that anyone with access to the nui_devtools can trigger NUI callbacks at will - that means you just introduced a way for people to call client and server events with only nui_devtools. A way to make this a lot more secure is to make a list of allowed events, and then have the NUI process tell you what event to call by the index of the allowed events. This way you can't call any event you want, only the ones you've allowed to. In a perfect world where every script is secure, you would have to worry less about this, but we're not there yet."]}),"\n"]})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.a)(),...e.components};return t?(0,o.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},1151:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>r,a:()=>i});var o=n(7294);const s={},a=o.createContext(s);function i(e){const t=o.useContext(a);return o.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:i(e.components),o.createElement(a.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
